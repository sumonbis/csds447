# CSDS 447 · Responsible AI Engineering
The deployment of modern AI systems presents new engineering challenges—bias amplification, safe autonomy, hallucinations, and more. This course teaches how to design and maintain AI-enabled software systems that meet key responsible-AI requirements: fairness, robustness, explainability, and safety. In addition to accuracy, we emphasize testing, verification, and maintainability of ML components. Students will read current research and complete a hands-on group project that applies these principles to a real system.
