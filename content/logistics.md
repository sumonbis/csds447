## Academic Integrity
Follow CWRU’s Undergraduate and Graduate Academic Integrity Policies. Violations are reported to the appropriate dean and the Office of Student Conduct & Community Standards.

## Policy on Using AI Tools
Generative AI tools may support research, brainstorming, and assignments, but usage must be transparent and responsible. You are accountable for originality and correctness and must be prepared to explain any AI-assisted work.

**Disclosure (3–5 sentences in every AI-assisted submission):**
- **Tool/Model Used:** (e.g., CWRU AI, Copilot, Llama)
- **Example Prompt(s):** A concise prompt that reflects how you used the tool
- **Verification Process:** How you checked accuracy/correctness/relevance

**Recommended Tools:** Prefer tools that protect data and align with academic integrity (e.g., CWRU AI, or locally run open-source models).
