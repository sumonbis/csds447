## Overview
The deployment of modern AI systems presents new engineering challengesâ€”bias amplification, safe autonomy, hallucinations, and more. This course teaches how to design and maintain AI-enabled software systems that meet key responsible-AI requirements: **fairness**, **robustness**, **explainability**, and **safety**. In addition to accuracy, we emphasize testing, verification, and maintainability of ML components. Students will read current research and complete a hands-on group project that applies these principles to a real system.

**Objectives**
- Software engineering for AI models and systems  
- Deep understanding of responsible-AI properties  
- Hands-on experience with evaluation and mitigation methods  
- Exposure to current research and open challenges

> The schedule below is **tentative** and will be updated as needed; changes will be announced in class and on Canvas.
